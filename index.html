                    <p>I've spent a good chunk of my career helping shape the world of tech, from the retail behemoth Amazon to nimble 
                        startups like Gather Vacations. At Amazon, I wore the hat of a Senior Technical Product Manager for Alexa Shopping
                        List, where we improved the UI worldwide and saw customers and usage rocket by 41% and 28% respectively, 
                        year-on-year. At Gather Vacations, we launched an onboarding pipeline that chopped down property live times by a whopping 30%. 
                        Did I mention that I also spearheaded Amazon Prime's strategy for some pretty big retail events? </p>
                        
                        <p>Bottom line: I enjoy diving deep into the tech world, leading teams, and creating products that users can't live without.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="Lead" class="tab">
                    <p>I've had the pleasure of leading some truly amazing teams in the tech space. At Gather Vacations, I wear multiple 
                        hats as the VP of Tech and Head of Product, guiding a diverse bunch of talented folks from developers and a data 
                        engineer to a technical solutions specialist. We're driving innovation and shaking things up in the vacation rental
                        management industry together! </p>

                        <p>Before Gather, I managed the pricing team at Bungalow, collaborating closely with data scientists to optimize our property rental 
                        revenues. I cut my leadership teeth at Amazon, where I helmed a team of eight driven program and marketing managers. 
                        Together, we orchestrated some of the biggest events for Amazon Prime. </p>
                        
                        <p>In essence, leading teams and driving success is my jam - whether we're talking about tech teams, product development,
                        or strategic initiatives.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="Strat" class="tab">
                    <p>Let's talk strategy - it's all about setting a clear, future-focused vision to guide the course. At Gather Vacations,
                        and back in my Amazon days, I cooked up long-term vision docs that mapped the destiny of the products I steered. But
                        visions need fuel to come to life. That's where my knack for smart prioritization kicks in. With a $500K+ tech
                        budget to manage at Gather, I've had to make tough calls to maximize impact.</p>
                        
                        <p>Whether it was at Gather, Bungalow, or Amazon, prioritizing technical resources has always been about 
                        striking the perfect balance between customer satisfaction and business results. In short, I'm all about dreaming big,
                        planning wisely, and getting the most bang for our buck. Bring on the next challenge!</p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="DE" class="tab">
                    <p>Data engineering is the foundation for which a lot of other teams rely, luckily I've had some great experiences. 
                        With Alexa Shopping List at Amazon, we launched a brand new API protocol that had a far-reaching impact - we're 
                        talking millions of customers worldwide and over 30 third-party stakeholders. </p>

                        <p> Over at Bungalow, I was at the helm, strategizing the data engineering team's queue. This was a crucial move 
                            to unblock the data pipeline for our data scientists, making sure they could continue their magic without a
                            hitch. </p>
                        
                        <p>And then there's Gather Vacations - where we took data infrastructure from 0 to 1. I'm talking about building a
                            robust data pipeline from the ground up, managed via AWS. This allowed us to seamlessly pull data from various
                            tools and dish out some truly insightful reports.</p>
                        
                        <p>In essence, I'm all about harnessing the power of data to drive success. Whether it's setting strategies, 
                            unblocking pipelines, or building infrastructure, you'll find me right there in the mix.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div id="DS" class="tab">
                    <p>I've had quite the adventure navigating the realms of data science in my career. At Bungalow, I teamed up with 
                        some incredibly smart data scientists to cook up a predictive pricing model, making our property rental revenues 
                        sing to a more profitable tune. </p>

                        <p>In my Amazon Prime days, I wore the Senior PM hat, and we created a nifty recommendation widget. It smartly 
                        suggested seasonally relevant items to customers, adding some extra sparkle to their shopping carts. It was all 
                        about getting into the mindset of our customers and predicting what they'd love next.</p>
                        
                        <p>Then, there was Alexa Shopping List. As a Senior Technical PM, we took 'smart' to a whole new level. Imagine 
                            adding an item to your shopping list and Alexa immediately suggesting the next item based on your previous 
                            choices - neat, right? </p>
                        
                        <p>In a nutshell, I absolutely love diving into data, uncovering insights, and using those nuggets of knowledge 
                            to create experiences customers adore!</p>
